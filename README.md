# DevOps/SRE: Learning Guide

This is a collection of a few topics and links I've found helpful in my own journey in the DevOps/SRE space.

## What is DevOps?
*DevOps* is a methodology that is a fusion of the traditional "developer" and "operator" roles.

## DevOps Engineer vs Site Reliability Engineer?
There is some debate in the tech community whether there is such thing as a "DevOps Engineer". Many prefer to use the term "Site Reliability Engineer" (including Google), or *SRE* for short.

*What should I call myself?* The one that gets you paid the most... I call myself a "Solutions Architect". I've met people who've had "Lead Ninja" on their business card. This industry is full of buzzwords and what's trendy. I've found *DevOps Engineer* to be more popular with recruiters and HR staff, while *SRE* is more used by those in the know.

## What OS should I use?
Your company/team might be orientated towards certain technologies which will effect what operating system you use. Personally I've found Unix based systems (Linux, OSX) the easiest to use for DevOps orientated work.

However, Some enterprise software will be limited to certain Operating Systems. *Microsoft Teams* and *Skype for Business* do not have official clients for Linux. Running a combo of Windows with a Linux virtual machine or the inverse will help get you over this hurdle. Or you could use OSX, which  provides flexibility in offering support for enterprise software in addition to the goodness that comes with a Unix based system.

## What should I learn?
The **[DevOps Roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap#devops-roadmap)** by *kamranahmedse* is one of the best resources I've found that lists the learning path of DevOps. Below is a list of some of my favourite blogs and videos that make up a small fraction of technologies mentioned in the Roadmap.
